            <h1>What is nuclear power?</h1>
            <h3>
                Nuclear power is a clean and efficient energy that comes from splitting atoms in a reactor to heat water into steam, 
                turn a turbine and generate electricity. About 440 power reactors around the world produce 12 percent of the energy 
                produced by nuclear power. It is the second largest source of low-carbon power.

            <h1>Where does the energy come from?</h1>
            <h3>
                The energy comes from an element called uranium. Uranium-235 is a stable type of uranium that consists of 92 protons 
                and 143 neutrons in its nucleus. When we fire a neutron to an uranium-235, it becomes uranium-236 and that’s an unstable 
                that would want to react and split up into smaller atoms, barium (56 protons and 81 neutrons in the nucleus), krypton 
                (36 protons and 45 neutrons in the nucleus) and a neutron. The process of splitting up the nucleus of uranium-236 releases 
                energy that was used to connect the protons and neutrons. The neutron from the reaction will also collide with other uranium-235 
                and trigger more reactions to create more energy.

            <h1>How did we develop to use nuclear energy?</h1>
            <h3>
                Bombardment of neutrons: In 1935, physicist Enrico Fermi conducted experiments in Rome that showed neutrons could split atoms. 
                He also bombarded uranium and concluded that he created new elements.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Discovery of Fission: In 1938, German scientist Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann fired neutrons at uranium and found that the elements 
                they get are weighted much less than uranium. Later Lise Meitner figured that the split must have converted to energy following 
                Albert Einstein’s E=mc^2 equation
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Chain Reaction: Frédéric Joliot, H. Von Halban and L. Kowarski in Paris discovered neutron multiplication in uranium, proving that 
                a nuclear chain reaction by this mechanism was indeed possible.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                First nuclear reactor: In 1942, Fermi and a group of scientists gathered at the University of Chicago to develop their theories 
                about self-sustaining reactions. The reactor they built was later known as Chicago Pile-1.
