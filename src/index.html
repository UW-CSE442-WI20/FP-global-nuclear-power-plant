      <h2>Nuclear power in the USA</h2>
      <p>Our <b>98 commercial reactors</b> supply <b>19.31%</b> of our country's energy and produce 807 Terawatt Hours of energy
        every year. That's enough to supply over <b>70 million households</b> with a year of energy!</p>
      <p>The first nuclear power plant was build in 1958 after President Eisenhower gave his well-known
         Atoms for Peace speech and the industry has continued to grow ever since.</p>
      <p>The 1970's saw a growth of the industry as the environmental movement was formed
        and people saw the advantage of nuclear power in reducing air pollution.
        However, in 1979, the Three Island Accident caused a radiation leak which lead to the closure of over a
        dozen nuclear power plants.</p>
      <p>There was a revival of interest in nuclear power in the 2000s, with talk of a "nuclear renaissance",
        supported particularly by the Nuclear Power 2010 Program. Right now there are currently 2 plants
        under construction.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Power in China</h2>
            <p>China is one of the largest producers of nuclear power in the world. It ranks <b>3rd in the world</b> both in total nuclear power capacity installed and electricity 
              generated, accounting for <b>10% of global nuclear power</b>. Nuclear power contributed 4.9% of the total chinese 
              electricity production in 2019 with 45 reactors, almost a <b>20% increase </b> from 2018.</p>
              <p>Most of the nuclear plants are on the coast and use seawater for cooling. In 1955, the China National Nuclear 
              Corporation was established. In 1970, China issued its first nuclear power plan. Since then, it has Energy Development Strategy Action Plan 2014-2020 to have a 
              58 GW capacity by 2020 with 30 GW more under construction.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Power in Japan</h2>
            <p>In regards to nuclear power, Japan is best known for the Fukushima Disaster in 2011. Prior to that, Japan got <b>30%</b> of its energy 
              from nuclear power. In 1954, Japan budgeted 230 million yen for nuclear energy, marking the beginning of Japan's 
              nuclear program that continued to be strong into the 21st century. However, when the Tohuku earthquake lead to the <b>triple reactor meltdown</b> in Fukushima, it lead to widespread
              distrust for nuclear power. The World Bank estimated costs for the earthquake to be <b>over $235 billion USD</b>, making it
              the costliest natural disaster in history.</p>
            <p>Despite the Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II and the Fukushima Disaster, Japan recognized nuclear power as the country’s most important power source as it aims for a 
              realistic and balanced energy structure, hoping that by 2030, nuclear power will produce 20% of Japan's electricity.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear Power in France</h2>
            <p>Nuclear power is the largest source of electricity in France, deriving about <b>75%</b> of its electricity from nuclear energy,
              the <b>highest percentage in the world</b>. Électricité de France – the country's main electricity generation and distribution
              company – manages the country's 58 power reactors.</p>
            <p>Since France lacked oil resources, Prime Minister Messmer announced the Messmer Plan in 1973, a huge nuclear power program
              aimed at generating all of France's electricity from nuclear power. In 2018, based on energy security, the government planned to reduce the country's electric nuclear 
              power to 50% by 2035 and increase its wind, biomass, and solar power electricity output. In February 2020, France shut down its oldest power plant
              after 43 years of operation, however there's still hardly a sign the country will reduce its reliance on nuclear energy anytime soon.

            <h2>Nuclear Power in Australia</h2>
            <p>Australia has <b>never had a nuclear power station</b>. With its low-cost coal and natural gas reserves, Australia has been able 
              to avoid nuclear power. However, the last couple decades saw much debate on the topic of nuclear energy. In 1998, The Australian Radiation
              Protection and Nuclear Safety Act was established. While in 2007, Prime Minister John Howard
              urged nuclear power as a way to reduce global warming effects in Australia. More recently though in 2019, the federal government recommended the ban be 
              removed for advanced nuclear reactors.</p>
