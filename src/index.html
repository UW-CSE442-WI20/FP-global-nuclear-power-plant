      When a uranium nucleus fissions into two daughter nuclei fragments, about 0.1 percent of the mass of the uranium nucleus
      appears as the fission energy of ~200 MeV. For uranium-235 (total mean fission energy 202.79 MeV[8]), typically ~169 MeV
      appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light, due to Coulomb
      repulsion. Also, an average of 2.5 neutrons are emitted, with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2 MeV (total of 4.8 MeV).
      The fission reaction also releases ~7 MeV in prompt gamma ray photons. The latter figure means that a nuclear fission
      explosion or criticality accident emits about 3.5% of its energy as gamma rays, less than 2.5% of its energy as fast
      neutrons (total of both types of radiation ~ 6%), and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments (this appears almost
      immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter, as simple heat).[10][11] In an atomic bomb, this heat may serve
      to raise the temperature of the bomb core to 100 million kelvin and cause secondary emission of soft X-rays, which convert
      some of this energy to ionizing radiation. However, in nuclear reactors, the fission fragment kinetic energy remains as
      low-temperature heat, which itself causes little or no ionization.
